# Full Stack Open Course Repository
This repository was created for the submissions for the exercises at Full Stack Open. Read More: https://fullstackopen.com/en/about/

I have separated the repository into 2 directories:
  1. exercises: Contains all the exercises for every part. Intended for submission.
  2. follow-throughs: Codes generated by following through the course.
